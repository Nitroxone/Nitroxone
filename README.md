- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nitroxone, sometimes shortened as 'ntrx'.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to web programming, languages like Java/Rust/Python, UI/UX, and graphical design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Rust, C++ and a bunch of other cool things at the University of Limoges (France).
- 💞️ I’m down to collaborate on anything if I have some spare time !
- 📫 You can reach me on my Twitter @omgitsnitroxone, or via email thenitroxone@gmail.com !
